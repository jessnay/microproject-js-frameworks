## Microproject-js-frameworks

## Project Instructions: 
You will create an express application:

1- Install the full Express required and recommended dependencies: 
2- Install Express 
3- Install Nodemon
4- Add a folder named “data” inside the project folder. Inside the “data” folder add a JSON file with at least 6 items (objects)
5- Adding a "public" folder for a full well-designed HTML website (static website):
6- 4 HTML pages at least
7- images/media and professional (nice and elegant) CSS
8- One of the HTML pages will be a demo for using API (Application Programming Interface) request to a back-end side (server-side) to load the JSON data (using Express with Node for sure)
9- This page should include a button to communicate with Express URL Route to call (fetch) JSON data
10- The JSON data that you will grab/load from the server-side should be displayed in a nicely formatted and professional layout to the end user (clients) in this page
you will need a JavaScript file to handle the front-end interactions with the user where you will attach an event listener to the button of the page. When the user clicks the button you will call function with 
11- Async/Await* to fetch the data according to the URL that you specified (or will specify) in your application JS file.
12- Async/Await is the syntactic sugar of using promises 
13- For sure, you will have to add the JavaScript file for running Express using the local virtual server "localhost"
14- Use any name you prefer to this Express application JavaScript file (by default, programmers use app.js or you can use index.js)
15- Write the full template/boilerplate of Express from you repos code examples or the express documentations
https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html
16- Import or require the JSON file to be saved into a variable of any name of your choice
17- Add the .get() method with a specific route to send the JSON Data which the variable that you have created that contains the JSON content. Notice that the URL and the end-point of this get() method will be used in your client-side JavaScript file.
